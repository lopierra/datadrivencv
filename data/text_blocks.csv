intro,"I'm a scientist, communicator, and project manager with a passion for helping people work together and share their research. In the past 3 years, I've turned my focus on data, learning R, Markdown, Shiny, SQL, Git, and other tools that make data visualization and reporting more reproducible and collaborative. 

I'm looking for a position where I can build tools that help my team explore and share their data, while continuing to grow my programming skills."
